# Analysis Folder

This folder is intended to store all the analysis outputs generated from the project. 

It can include:

- CSV files with aggregated results
- Plots and figures

💡 **Note**: The main scripts that generate these analyses are located in the `etl/` folder, such as `run_and_export_analysis_sql.py` and `run_rfm_analysis.py`. This folder serves as the storage for their outputs and any additional exploration results.
